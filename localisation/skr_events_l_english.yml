Most democrats know that this election wont be easy, it will be hard, as the democrats have earned the nickname "The Davis-Bryan Party", referring to the two presidents that tried to heal the US during the start of the depression, with horrible results.

 usa.7.d:0 "Alfred Landon has decided to keep with the tradition set by George Washington in 1796 and deny a third term, this left the republican nomination wide open.

The democrats this time nominated the conservative John Garner, as many leftists have jumped ship to the socialist party or the progressive wing of the republican party. Wilkie has been endorsed by the popular Landon and many others. For the public, the question isnt who will win, its how big the landslide for Wilkie will be, that will be answered in the south, as its the democratic powerhouse even in 1932."
