 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "1936"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The old monarchist order of Europe has fallen, In 1916 Hungary wanted to heavily hungarize its non-hungarian speaking areas, however the South German Federation opposed this and declared war on Hungary. North Germany saw a possibility of uniting Germany and sided with Hungary. France feared the power of North Germany and sided with Hungary. More interests were seized and Europe descended into flames. The losers became angry and many abandoned their old governments, France turned to fascism, SGF to communism. Now 20 years later, France looks like it might try for revenge..."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom tried to stay neutral in the war, but after symphaties shifted towards Hungary and Germany during the war because France attacked Belgium and many saw the SGF as the aggressor many wanted to go to war, so they did and the British entrance into the war helped end it dramatically. The UK insisted on Bavarian independendence on grounds of self-determination. Some have hounded UK as a hypocrite because it didnt prevent the magyar takeover of Croatia."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "To appease german nationalists in the south and hungarian ones to the east, Hungary was given their own nation under Hapsburg rule in hopes of getting the south germans to unite with Austria to create the SGF. It worked, the SGF was created and another revolt on the scale of 1848 was prevented. Hungary gradually moved away from Wien and got its own king and regent, Miklos Horthy and Gyula Gömbos respectively in 1904. Twelve years later, heavy hungarization policies lead to the Great War, which Hungary won. Croatia was absorbed into Hungary and now Hungary sees a period of growth. Ethnic tensions are being ruled out with the same policies that started the Great War."
